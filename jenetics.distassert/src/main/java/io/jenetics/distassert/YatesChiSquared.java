/**
 * Implements the Yates's chi-squared test.
 * <blockquote>
 * In statistics, Yates's correction for continuity (or Yates's chi-squared test)
 * is used in certain situations when testing for independence in a contingency
 * table. It aims at correcting the error introduced by assuming that the
 * discrete probabilities of frequencies in the table can be approximated by a
 * continuous distribution (chi-squared). Unlike the standard Pearson chi-squared
 * statistic, it is approximately unbiased.
 * <br>
 * The effect of Yates's correction is to prevent overestimation of statistical
 * significance for small data. This formula is chiefly used when at least one
 * cell of the table has an expected count smaller than 5.
