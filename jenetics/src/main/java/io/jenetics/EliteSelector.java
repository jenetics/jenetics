/**
 * The {@code EliteSelector} copies a small proportion of the fittest candidates,
 * without changes, into the next generation. This may have a dramatic impact on
 * performance by ensuring that the GA doesn't waste time re-discovering
 * previously refused partial solutions. Individuals that are preserved through
 * elitism remain eligible for selection as parents of the next generation.
 * Elitism is also related to memory: remember the best solution found so far.
 * A problem with elitism is that it may cause the GA to converge to a local
 * optimum, so pure elitism is a race to the nearest local optimum.
