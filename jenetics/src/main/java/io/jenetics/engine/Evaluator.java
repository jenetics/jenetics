/**
 * This interface allows defining different strategies for evaluating the
 * fitness functions of a given population. <em>Normally</em> there is no
 * need for <em>overriding</em> the default evaluation strategy, but it might
 * be necessary if you have performance problems and a <em>batched</em>
 * fitness evaluation would solve the problem.
 * <p>
 * The implementer is free to do the evaluation <em>in place</em>, or create
 * new {@link Phenotype} instance and return the newly created one. A simple
 * serial evaluator can easily implement:
 *
 * {@snippet lang="java":
 * final Function<? super Genotype<G>, ? extends C> fitness = null; // @replace substring='null' replacement="..."
 * final Evaluator<G, C> evaluator = population -> population
 *     .map(pt -> pt.eval(fitness))
 *     .asISeq();
 *
 * final Engine<G, C> engine = new Engine.Builder<>(evaluator, genotypeFactory)
 *     .build();
 * }
 *
 * @apiNote
 * The size of the returned, evaluated, phenotype sequence must be exactly
 * the size of the input phenotype sequence, and all phenotypes must have a
 * fitness value assigned ({@code assert population.forAll(Phenotype::isEvaluated);}).
 * It is allowed to return the input sequence, after evaluation, as well as a newly
 * created one.
 *
 * @see Evaluators
 * @see Engine
 *
 * @param <G> the gene type
 * @param <C> the fitness result type
