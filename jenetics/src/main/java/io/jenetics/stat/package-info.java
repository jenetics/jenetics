/**
 * This package contains additional statistics classes which are not available
 * in the Java core library. Java only includes classes for calculating the sum
 * and the average of a given numeric stream (e. g.
 * {@code DoubleSummaryStatistics}). With the additions in this package it is
 * also possible to calculate the variance, skewness and kurtosis---using the
 * {@code DoubleMomentStatistics} class. The {@code EvolutionStatistics} object,
 * which can be calculated for every generation, relies on the classes of this
 * package.
