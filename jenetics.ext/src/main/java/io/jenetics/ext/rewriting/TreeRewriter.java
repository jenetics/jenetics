/**
 * Interface for rewriting a given tree. The rewrite is performed on a mutable
 * {@link TreeNode} and is done in place.
 * <p>
 * <b>Description from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewriting">
 *     Wikipedia: </a></b>
 * <em>
 *     In mathematics, computer science, and logic, rewriting covers a wide
 *     range of (potentially non-deterministic) methods of replacing sub-terms
 *     of a formula with other terms. In their most basic form, they consist of
 *     a set of objects, plus relations on how to transform those objects.
 *     Rewriting can be non-deterministic. One rule to rewrite a term could be
 *     applied in many different ways to that term, or more than one rule could
 *     be applicable. Rewriting systems then do not provide an algorithm for
 *     changing one term to another, but a set of possible rule applications.
 *     When combined with an appropriate algorithm, however, rewrite systems can
 *     be viewed as computer programs, and several theorem provers and
 *     declarative programming languages are based on term rewriting.
 * </em>
