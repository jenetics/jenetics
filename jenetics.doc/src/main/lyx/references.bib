The function fills a gap in the presently available subset selection software, which typically searches over a range of subset sizes, restricts the types of objective functions considered, or does not include freely available code. The new function is demonstrated on two types of problem where a fixed-size subset search is desirable: design of environmental monitoring networks, and D-optimal design of experiments. Additionally, the performance is evaluated on a class of constructed test problems with a novel design that is interesting in its own right.},

A predictive model for the BGA is presented that is derived from quantitative genetics. The model is used to predict the behavior of the BGA for simple test functions. Different mutation schemes are compared by computing the expected progress to the solution. The numerical performance of the BGA is demonstrated on a test suite of multimodal functions. The number of function evaluations needed to locate the optimum scales only as n ln(n) where n is the number of parameters. Results up to n = 1000 are reported.},

problems, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) must now show their efficacy in
handling problems having more than two objectives. In this paper, we have suggested three
different approaches for systematically designing test problems for this purpose. The simplicity
of construction, scalability to any number of decision variables and objectives, knowledge of
exact shape and location of the resulting Pareto-optimal front, and introduction of controlled
difficulties in both converging to the true Pareto-optimal front and maintaining a widely
distributed set of solutions are the main features of the suggested test problems. Because
of the above features, they should be found useful in various research activities on MOEAs,
such as testing the performance of a new MOEA, comparing different MOEAs, and better
understanding of the working principles of MOEAs.},

On the one hand, they do not allow the generation of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) composed of more than one hidden-layer. On the other, there is no way to evolve networks with more than one output neuron. To properly evolve ANNs with more than one hidden-layer and multiple output nodes there is the need to know the number of neurons available in previous layers. In this paper we introduce Dynamic Structured Grammatical Evolution (DSGE): a new genotypic representation that overcomes the aforementioned limitations. By enabling the creation of dynamic rules that specify the connection possibilities of each neuron, the methodology enables the evolution of multi-layered ANNs with more than one output neuron. Results in different classification problems show that DSGE evolves effective single and multi-layered ANNs, with a varying number of output neurons.},

  abstract  = {Grammar-guided Genetic Programming (G3P) is a family of Evolutionary Algorithms that can evolve programs in any language described by a context-free grammar. The most widespread members of this family are based on an indirect representation: a sequence of bits or integers (the genotype) is transformed into a string of the language (the phenotype) by means of a mapping function, and eventually into a fitness value. Unfortunately, the flexibility brought by this mapping is also likely to introduce non-locality phenomena, reduce diversity, and hamper the effectiveness of the algorithm. In this paper, we experimentally characterize how population diversity, measured at different levels, varies for four popular G3P approaches. We then propose two strategies for promoting diversity which are general, independent both from the specific problem being tackled and from the other components of the Evolutionary Algorithm, such as genotypeâ€“phenotype mapping, selection criteria, and genetic operators. We experimentally demonstrate their efficacy in a wide range of conditions and from different points of view. The results also confirm the preponderant importance of the phenotype-level analyzes in diversity promotion.},
